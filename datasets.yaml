        This is a TEI-encoded list of all places mentioned in the WIBARAB project.
        Originally stemming from VICAV, the list is extended in WIBARAB both by quantity 
        and quality: On the one hand, more places are being added by the editorial team 
        during data collection, on the other hand is planned that regions (marked 
        with @type='region' on `<place>`) geoshapes will be added / 
        in order to render regions on the map).

        note: > 
          From point of view of the WIBARAB project, the VICAV place list is  
          static as any manual changes will be kept in the WIBARAB namespace but
          should be ported back to VICAV when finished.
